# FireFoxOneLinerCSS
This is a custom interface which puts everything on the navbar in one line via userChrome.css and also adds a black background to the homepage and the settings pages via userContent.css
I've also added BetterFox's user.js in this with a couple of overrides which I like.



HOW TO INSTALL:

    Download and unzip (from Repo or from Releases)
    Go to about:profiles in Firefox and open your Profile Folder by selecting root directory
    Drop the user.js in the root folder
    Drop your unzipped "chrome" folder into the folder that appears
    Go to about:config in your Firefox and set the value of toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true (this enables the loading of userChrome mods)
    Restart Firefox
